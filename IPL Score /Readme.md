# 🏏 IPL Score Prediction – Machine Learning Project

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to **predict the final innings score** of an IPL team based on overs, wickets, run rate, player performance factors, and match situation. The notebook includes full data preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## 📌 Problem Statement  
Build a machine learning model that can accurately **predict the final total score** of a batting team in the Indian Premier League based on real-time match inputs.

---

## 📊 Dataset Insights  
The dataset contains ball-by-ball or over-by-over match details such as:

- `batting_team`
- `bowling_team`
- `overs`
- `runs`
- `wickets`
- `runs_last_5`
- `wickets_last_5`
- `striker`
- `non-striker`
- `bowler`

These columns help understand match context and scoring patterns.

## 🔧 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ **Data Preprocessing**
- Handling null values  
- Encoding categorical variables  
- Removing irrelevant features  
- Feature transformation (if required)

### 2️⃣ **Exploratory Data Analysis**
- Run distribution  
- Wickets vs runs correlation  
- Overs vs scoring rate  
- Outlier detection  
- Team-wise scoring patterns  

### 3️⃣ **Feature Engineering**
- Adding scoring momentum features  
- Recent over performance  
- Run rate calculation  
- Pressure indicators  

### 4️⃣ **Model Training**
Models used:
- Linear Regression  
- Random Forest Regressor  
- XGBoost Regressor  
- AdaBoost Regressor  

Performance metrics:
- R² Score  
- MAE  
- RMSE  

### 5️⃣ **Model Evaluation**
Final model is selected based on:
- Highest R²  
- Lowest error  
- Stability across test data
